# Open Feedback

**Open Feedback** is an opened SaaS platform for organisers and speakers to gather users feedback. It connects to one of 3 data source: OpenFeedback database, hoverboard-v2, or your own API, to retrieve all the sessions & speakers. Anonymous users can give constructive feedbacks on sessions, and admins can manage the voting form, comments, languages, sessions and speakers directly within the GUI.
