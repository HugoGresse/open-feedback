        "voteIncreaseAnswer": "Without much communication, not many feedback will be received through Open Feedback. <br/> <br/> <strong>To increase this, you may try the following:</strong><br/> - display QRCode on wall, website, printed map/design <br/> - notify attendees/voters to give feedbacks after the event. Doing this, ensure you let add some days to the vote end time. <br/> - promote OpenFeedback to all speakers so they display the QRCode going directly to their talk during their Q&A.",
