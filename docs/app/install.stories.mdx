# Installation

## Pre-requisites

- node@10.16.0
- npm

## Setup

### Configure Firebase
Create a firebase project with the [firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com).

1. Create a "Cloud Firestore" Database. It's okay to start in 'locked' mode. The rules will be overriden when you deploy.
2. Activate "Anonymous" as a sign-in provider for Authentication of voters
3. Activate "Google" as a sign-in provider for Admin Authentication. (You may want to add Email/Pwd", "Phone", "Google", "GitHub" later on)
4. Create a `.env.local` file by copying `.env` file at root folder and set firebase environment variables. You can get all these variables from the Firebase Console homepage by clicking "Add an application" and selecting the web icon.

  * `REACT_APP_ADMIN_EMAIL=<ADMIN_EMAIL>`
  * `REACT_APP_APPID=<APP_ID>`
  * `REACT_APP_API_KEY=<API_KEY>`
  * `REACT_APP_AUTH_DOMAIN=<AUTH_DOMAIN>`
  * `REACT_APP_DATABASE_URL=<DATABASE_URL>`
  * `REACT_APP_PROJECT_ID=<PROJECT_ID>`
  * `REACT_APP_STORAGE_BUCKET=<STORAGE_BUCKET>`
  * `REACT_APP_MEASUREMENT_ID=<MEASUREMENT_ID>` (replace Google Analytics specific configuration)

5. In package.json, change `homepage` to your instance url.

### Configure Mailgun (optional)
The application sends emails through the Mailgun API

You have to create a Mailgun account if you want to send those emails, if not the app will still works perfectly but without sending any email.

Mailgun API is used to send email through Cloud Functions, so you will have to add environment variables with Firebase CLI:

- The application URL: app.url (ex: `http://localhost:3000`)
- The API key: mailgun.key
- The domain name: mailgun.domain
- The Mailgun API url: mailgun.api (ex https://api.eu.mailgun.net/v3/SOMETHINGLIKE_THIS/messages)

Here the command to register those variables:

    firebase functions:config:set app.url="https://myserver.com" mailgun.key="MAILGUN API KEY" mailgun.domain="MAILGUN DOMAIN"  mailgun.api="https://api.eu.mailgun.net/v3/SOMETHINGLIKE_THIS/messages"

To test cloud functions with Mailgun on your local machine (with cloud function shell), you will need to generate ``.runtimeconfig.json` file with environment variables :

    firebase functions:config:get > .runtimeconfig.json

> Important Note: Mailgun is an external service from Firebase and Google, so to be able use it with you will need to activate Firebase pricing.

### Configure OpsGenie (optional)
The application report alerting using OpsGenie, it is optional and the app will still works perfectly but without any alerting.

You will have to add environment variables with Firebase CLI:

- The application URL: app.url (ex: `http://localhost:3000`)
- The OpsGenie API key: opsgenie.key
- The OpsGenie api domain: opsgenie.api
- For contact email (optional): app.contactemail
- For contact email captcha, the recaptcha V3 Secret: app. recaptchav3secret

Here the command to register those variables:

    firebase functions:config:set app.url="https://myserver.com" opsgenie.api="https://api.eu.opsgenie.com" opsgenie.key="xxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx"

To test alerting on your local machine (with cloud function shell), you will need to generate ``.runtimeconfig.json` file with environment variables :

    firebase functions:config:get > .runtimeconfig.json

> Important Note: OpsGenie is an external service from Firebase and Google, so to be able use it with you will need to activate Firebase pricing.

### Configure SmallChat (optional)
Smallchat provide a live support interface for your web app. It's the "Send a message" at the bottom right that allow users to communicate directly with the you.
SmallChat has a free tier and you can answer from Slack directly.

1. Create your account on [small.chat](https://small.chat/)
2. Add the js url to the desired env file (ex: `.env.local`):
    ```
    # Small Chat (custom live support)
    REACT_APP_SMALL_CHAT=https://embed.small.chat/T<someNumbers>.js
    ```


## Run

### Run the app in dev mode


1. Clone the Open Feedback app and install dependencies
    ```
    git clone git@github.com:HugoGresse/open-feedback.git
    npm i
    ```
2. Configure the app with [Firebase](#configure-firebase)
3. Start the app
    ```
    npm start
    ```

    >Before using the app, you'll need to deploy the firestore security rules at least once (see below for how to deploy with firebase)

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app in the browser.

## Cloud functions

The project uses cloud functions for vote aggregations. Before deploying the application, you need to resolve cloud functions dependencies.

All commands must be done in `/functions` folder with **node@8**.

Cloud functions uses its own `package.json`, first install dependencies:
```
npm i
```

The next deploy will also deploy Firebase Cloud Functions

## Deploy

### Pre-requisites
1. Install firebase-cli :
    ```
    npm install firebase-tools -g
    ```

2. You must be logged with firebase and select project ([Firebase documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web)) :
    ```
    firebase login
    firebase use --add
    ```
3. Install dependencies for the app and cloud functions.

### Build and deploy the app

```
npm run deploy
```

Install dependencies for the app and cloud functions.

The first time your run the app, it may fail to do firestore queries due to missing indexes. If that happens, you'll see an error message in the console with a link that you can follow to create the indices.
