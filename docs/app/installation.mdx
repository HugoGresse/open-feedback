# Installation

## Pre-requisites

- node@10.16.0 
- npm

## Setup

### Configure Firebase
Create a firebase project with the [firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com).

1. Create a "Cloud Firestore" Database. It's okay to start in 'locked' mode. The rules will be overriden when you deploy.
2. Activate "Anonymous" as a sign-in provider for Authentication of voters
3. Activate "Google" as a sign-in provider for Admin Authentication. (You may want to add Email/Pwd", "Phone", "Google", "GitHub" later on)
4. Create a `src/config.js` file by copying .config.example.js file at `src/` folder and set firebase environment variables. You can get all these variables from the Firebase Console homepage by clicking "Add an application" and selecting the web icon.

```
{
    firebaseMain: {
        apiKey: '',
        authDomain: '',
        databaseURL: '',
        projectId: '',
        storageBucket: ''
    },
    googleAnalyticsId: 'UA-00000000-1'
}
```

### Configure Google Analytics (optional)
You can add a Google Analytics by adding your Analytics ID to the `src/config.js` in `googleAnalyticsId`.

## Run

### Run the app in dev mode


1. Clone the Open Feedback app and install dependencies  
    ```
    git clone git@github.com:HugoGresse/open-feedback.git
    npm i
    ```
2. Configure the app with [Firebase](#configure-firebase)  
3. Start the app
    ```
    npm start
    ```
    
    >Before using the app, you'll need to deploy the firestore security rules at least once (see below for how to deploy with firebase)
    
4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app in the browser.

## Cloud functions

The project uses cloud functions for vote aggregations. Before deploying the application, you need to resolve cloud functions dependencies.

All commands must be done in `/functions` folder with **node@8**.

Cloud functions uses its own `package.json`, first install dependencies:
```
npm i
```

The next deploy will also deploy Firebase Cloud Functions

## Deploy

### Pre-requisites
1. Install firebase-cli :
    ```
    npm install firebase-tools -g
    ```
    
2. You must be logged with firebase and select project ([Firebase documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web)) :
    ```
    firebase login
    firebase use --add
    ```
3. Install dependencies for the app and cloud functions.

### Build and deploy the app
    
```
npm run deploy
```
