## Guidelines

### General guidelines

-   The `master` branch is where incoming new features are merged and where the next deploy will come from.
-   All hotfix should be done in dedicated branch from the `master` branch.
-   All new features / bugs should be done in dedicated branch from the `master` branch.
-   Organize your commit as you wish. They will be squashed upon merging.

### Adding new feature

Ideally you should talk about it on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/open-feedback) with other contributors or open a suggestion issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/HugoGresse/open-feedback/issues).
